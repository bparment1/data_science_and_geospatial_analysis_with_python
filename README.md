# Data science and geospatial analysis with python
This course contains materials that I have developped over the years for training and formal classes in data science and geospatial analysis. 

The course material is organized in different lessons/classes:

1. Introduction to python 

2. Vulnerability to lead in Syracuse: Introduction to spatial analysis and regression 
[notebook for spatial regression](https://github.com/bparment1/data_science_and_geospatial_analysis_with_python/blob/master/exercise2_spatial_analyses_and_regression_Syracuse.ipynb)

3. Temperature prediction using satellite imagery: Introduction to regression  

4. Predicting urban growth in Houston: An introduction to Land Change modeling

5. Hurricane Impact: interactive mapping using Folium and Leaflet

6. Temperature prediction methods comparison: Machine Learning introduction  

7. Binary classification method comparison: Machine Learning introduction

8. Flooding study: classification of flooding areas using MODIS satellite image data. 

9. Time Series forecasting with ARIMA: An example with Vegetation index from satellite

10. Trends and Seasonality: Trends in vegetation using Harmonic regression.

11. Spatial interpolation using Gaussian Process Regression: temperature application.
